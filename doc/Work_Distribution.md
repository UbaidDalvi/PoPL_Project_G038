# Work Distribution

## Amaan Sajid Nalakath
### Work done:
  Implemented Halide program without Tiling for Image processing Tasks of Brightness, Grayscale and Blur.
### Reason for this task:
  Halide has a very steep learning curve and so the task of Processing Images using Halide with Tiling would require a lot of time for this part. Hence, the task of Implementing the Halide code for basic Image processing without the tiling part was alloted to Amaan.

## Ubaid Dalvi
### Work done:
  Implemented the Halide program for Image processing with the Tiling part for breaking down the images into chunks and then processing each tile individually for each processing task such as brightness, grayscale and blur.
### Reason for this task:
  Halide was already being studied since long by Ubaid for the purpose of Other Image processing related Projects and had already performed some Tiling related Image processing before. Hence, the work of Tiling and Processing the Images in Halide was given to Ubaid.

## Apurva Patil:
### Work done:
  Implemented Python program without Tiling for Image processing Tasks of Brightness, Grayscale and Blur using OpenCV library. Also, performed benchmarking the Halide program implementing the Tiled processing for performance metrics evaluation using `perf stat` .
### Reason for this task:
  Python language is familiar to him and the libraries pertaining to OpenCV for Image processing was learnt during this project by Apurva. `perf` was used for Benchmarking the Halide programs.

## Suryaansh Tripathi:
### Work done:
